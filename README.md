# my-api-challenge
Repository for my fifth homework using Python, Pandas and working with APIs, where I use the data from two different APIs in order to determine the tendencies in a place's climate as they get nearer or further from the equator.

**Which APIs will I be using?**
I am working with two APIs:
- OpenWeatherMap API: they collect and process weather data from different sources such as global and local weather models, satellites, radars and a vast network of weather stations in order to obtain the current weather in a certain place.
- Google Maps APIs: The Places API is one of the APIs that Google Maps offers, and it is a service that returns information about places using HTTP requests. Places are defined within this API as establishments, geographic locations, or prominent points of interest.
